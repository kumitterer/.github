# NQRduck

## Introduction
This program is intended as a educational tool for magnetic resonance experiments (NMR, NQR, ...). It's focus lies on modular behaviour depending on what nqrduck modules are installed.

## Installation 
Installation instructions can be found in the nqrduck repository. Different modules can be installed to your liking and depending on what functionality you need. 

## NQRduck
The nqrduck module is the core application. It loads all the installed modules in your python environment. It also provides a central interface for communication between modules.
